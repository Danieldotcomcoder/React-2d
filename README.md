# KNN Classification Visualization in React

## Project Description

This project is a visualization of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. It uses colored balls to represent data points in clusters. Each color represents a different class. A new ball (data point) is added to the specific cluster based on its color (class).

## Features

- Visual representation of KNN classification.
- Interactive interface to add new data points.
- Color-coded data points for easy distinction between classes.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Danieldotcomcoder/React-2d
    ```
